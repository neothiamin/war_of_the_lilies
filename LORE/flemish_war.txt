The Flemish War is a possible outcome of the events leading to the War of the Lilies. It can come about in a few ways:

1) Burgundian Involvement in the Flemish Revolt, or

2) A declaration of independence from John the Invader (or JTI, from now on)

-----------------------------

Scenario 1 comes about when a) JTI executes a merchant in Flanders and is supported by the English ruler (or ER), leading to b) the Flemish Revolt, a peasant revolt in Flanders, which leads finally to c) Burgundian involvement in the Flemish Revolt and war between Burgundy and ENG/FLA.

Scenario 2 stems from the same event as in 1a, with the key difference that JTI is not supported by the ER. After a lack of support from the ER, JTI may question the legitimacy of the ER, subsequently leading to the possibility of JTI's title being revoked. The outcomes of this are either success (15%), JTI questioning the authority of the ER (35%), or total failure and a declaration of independence by JTI (50%).

No matter the cause, the Flemish War may lead to foreign intervention by a number of powers, including the aforementioned Burgundy, the Duke of Provence, the Holy Roman Emperor, Scotland, and even Castile.
