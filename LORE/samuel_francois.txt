Event outline for Samuel François (Saared)
--------------

The War of the Lilies is in full swing. French and English armies fight battles daily, and there is not yet a clear winner. However, there is a whole new class of soldiers in this war, a class whose participation is not found on the battlefield, but rather in the libraries of France.

Historians and dynastic experts spend hours and hours every day poring over dusty old tomes, manuscripts, tapestries, anything that could be used as a historical record. Recently, one such historian has made a shocking discovery. His name is Samuel François, and he claims to have found information that distinctly ties the [ENG.Dynasty.GetName]s to the French throne, bolstering our cause's legitimacy. He says this information would lead to guaranteed victory for us, and he is more than willing to give it to us... for a price.

b) What does some hobbled old bookworm know?

c) He would be more useful as an advisor.
