+ Added LORE folder! Read up!

+ Flemish Revolt Events! Play as England and stop John the Invader! Or play as Flanders and question England's legitimacy! Just be careful; foreign powers are always eager to step in...

* Some tweaks to province and country history, including lore-accurate personalities for rulers!

* Further increased severity of "Diplomacy Stretched Thin" modifier.

- Removed ability for GBR to form the United Monarchies. To be fair, no country can form them yet...
