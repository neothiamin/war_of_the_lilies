v0.2.1

+ Added some new progress modifiers for the WOTL disaster, so that the disaster can actually progress down now! It won't be easy, though...

+ Added the ability to avoid the War of the Lilies disaster altogether. If England gets to 1455 without the disaster firing, it won't fire at all.

* Reduced duration of the "Scars of War" modifier for France.

* Slightly altered the "Inspiring Speech" event for England so that it may only fire once per area.

* Slight tweak to the "Attempt to Rejoin France" decision requirements.

* Fixed the event "Victory for England/France!" not firing for France, and also firing when it shouldn't be.

* Fixed the "Walloon Support" event firing multiple times.

* Fixed the "Perhaps our dreams of an Anglic France are over..." event option bugging out and making France S T R O N K.

* Fixed modifier sticking around after the WOTL ends.

* Gave Normandy a core in Cotentin.

* Events meant for the WOTL should not fire when the WOTL is over anymore.

* Some slight tweaks to existing progress modifiers for the War of the Lilies disaster.
