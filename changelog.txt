v0.2pre1

+ Added LORE folder! Read up!

+ Flemish Revolt Events! Play as England and stop John the Invader! Or play as Flanders and question England's legitimacy! Just be careful; foreign powers are always eager to step in...

+ Subsequently, added the Flemish War! Sometimes, things get a little heated.

+ Added the Council of the Dukes! Gather all your ducal friends about and make demands of the King of England!

+ Brigandry runs rampant in France!

* Some tweaks to province and country history, including lore-accurate personalities for (some) rulers!

* Further increased severity of "Diplomacy Stretched Thin" modifier.

- Removed ability for GBR to form the United Monarchies. To be fair, no country can form them yet...
