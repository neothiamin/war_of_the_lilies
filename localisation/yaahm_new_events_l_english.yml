The merchants postulate about \"how much higher profits would be\" if Your Majesty were not the one issuing taxes and tariffs on goods traded in the markets of Paris and Reims.\"\n\n In the South, it is said that your vassal, [GUY.Monarch.GetName], is incompetent, and illegitimate. Open rebellion is common, and even the lowliest peasant is known to keep a sharpened pitchfork in his shed.\n\nAnd in the Lowlands, some speak of your cousin, the [FLA.Monarch.GetTitle] of [FLA.GetName], and [FLA.Monarch.GetHerHis] ruthless ways. \"The Invader,\" they call [FLA.Monarch.GetHerHim].\n\nYour Majesty, I would not write to you if I were not so deeply troubled, not only for your well-being, but for the well-being of your people.

Were we to renovate the Palais and repair the battlements, the complex could server as a shining example of our dedication to our people."

This time, though, one too many heads have rolled.\n\nJohn has just executed a merchant, [FLA.executed_fleming.GetName], for \"treason and conspiracy against the Crown\"; however, it seems that, unlike with his previous victims, his court has been unable to find (or fabricate) a single shred of evidence.
