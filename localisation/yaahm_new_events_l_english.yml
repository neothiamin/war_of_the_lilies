As you know, your rule as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.GetName] is most righteous, and indeed hath been ordained by our Lord in Heaven above Himself. There are, however, some who question your rule.\"\n\n\"On the Continent, there is word, amongst the peasantry and Old Guard alike, of concepts nothing short of treason. The merchants postulate about \"how much higher profits would be\" if Your Majesty were not the one issuing taxes and tariffs on goods traded in the markets of Paris and Reims.\"\n\n In the South, it is said that your vassal, [GUY.Monarch.GetName], is incompetent, and illegitimate. Open rebellion is common, and even the lowliest peasant is known to keep a sharpened pitchfork in his shed.\n\nAnd in the Lowlands, some speak of your cousin, the [FLA.Monarch.GetTitle] of [FLA.GetName], and [FLA.Monarch.GetHerHis] ruthless ways. \"The Invader,\" they call [FLA.Monarch.GetHerHim].\n\nYour Majesty, I would not write to you if I were not so deeply troubled, not only for your well-being, but for the well-being of your people. We are doing the best we can to stifle dissent and reassure the peasantry that all will be well, but we fear our wo---ma--------lling on de----ar----.\n\n---odspee----,\n\nYo------mbl------ssal...\"\n\nThe rest of the note is illegible, a jumbled mess of strokes and tears in the parchment."

 wotl_anf.1.desc:0 "The Palais du Louvre was built as a fortress to watch over the right bank of the Seine in Paris. Under Charles V of France, the fortress was renovated to functions as a royal palace, should the need arise.\n\nHowever, after the Second Treaty of Bourges, the Palais du Louvre fell into disrepair, and now sits as a delapidated old structure that is both hideous and a reminder of the Ancien Regime of France. Were we to renovate the Palais and repair the battlements, the complex could server as a shining example of our dedication to our people."

Anglo-French flags hang billowing in the wind at all corners of the complex, and stained glass ornaments every window. Truly, this is a marvel of engineering. Your home awaits, Your Majesty."

 wotl_eng.3.desc:0 "Your Majesty,\n\nYour cousin, Duke John of Beaufort, known as \"The Invader\" among his detractors and much of the peasantry in his domain of Flanders, has once again shown why he has been ascribed that moniker.\n\nJohn recently has been increasingly paranoid, fully aware of the fact that he, an Englishman, rules over a duchy of Flemings, and has begun fully exercising his right as chief \"executive\". This time, though, one too many heads have rolled.\n\nJohn has just executed a merchant, [FLA.executed_fleming.GetName], for \"treason and conspiracy against the Crown\"; however, it seems that, unlike with his previous victims, his court has been unable to find (or fabricate) a single shred of evidence. Word of this seemingly arbitrary and tyrannical execution has made its way from the throne room to the town square in Brugge, and word of rebellion is on the Flemings' lips..."
 wotl_eng.4.desc:0 "Your Majesty,\n\nWord has reached us that John of Beaufort has issued a formal decree stating his doubt in Your ability to rule effectively!
