As You know, Your rule as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of England and France is most righteous, and indeed hath been ordained by our Lord in Heaven above Himself. There are, however, some who question your rule.\n\nOn the Continent, Your rule is being enforced around France, and any talk of treason against the Crown stifled.\n\nThat said, there are many petty duchies in the South of France who outright reject Your rule. The old dukes of Auvergne and Toulouse have declared independence, and a warlord in the Alps has taken advantage of their resulting isolation to carve out a \"duchy\" of their own. The Archbishop of Reims has long since declared the city of Reims independent from Your rule, and in Orleans a council of mayors and petty nobles awaits a \"legitimate\" heir.\n\nYour Majesty, I would not write to you if I were not so deeply troubled, not only for your well-being, but for the well-being of your people."
