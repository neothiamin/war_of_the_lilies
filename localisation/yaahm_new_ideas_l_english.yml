 guy_accesion_of_john_desc: "John IV was Duke of Armagnac during the Righteous War. However, after the Dissolution of France, all vassals of the French \"King\" were made subjects of England... except John IV. During the Second Treaty of Bourges, John the Magnanimous saw fit to recreate the old Duchy of Aquitaine, and he chose John IV to be the new Duke. The Accession of John IV is the popular term for this event, and is seen as a landmark moment in the history of the Aquitainian people."
 guy_gironde_estuary_desc: "The Garonne flows generally north-west from its source in the Pyrenees before entering the Bay of Biscay at the Gironde Estuary, a major waterway connecting the city of Bordeaux to the greater Atlantic Ocean. By developing towns and checkpoints along the Gironde Estuary, we can create a larger mercantile presence for our nation."
 guy_massif_central_desc: "Le Massif Central is a large plateau covering much of the regions of Auvergne and Limousin. Its valleys and peaks create many narrow passes and bottlenecks for foot traffic. We ought to construct fortifications all throughout the Massif Central to defend our lands against enemies both internal and external."
 guy_french_legacy_desc: "Though none would want to admit it, our people share a great deal of our history with the people of the Langues d'Oil. By exploiting the prestige associated with the Parisian dialect, and making clear out connection to it, we can better conduct diplomacy."
 guy_dual_alliances_desc: "Our position between the French region and the nations of Iberia, along with our connections to England through the centuries, have taught our people how to play larger forces off of each other to protect our own sovereignty. By training diplomats in the art of dual diplomacy, we can maintain our own existence with ease."
 guy_centralization_desc: "Through careful study of Roman, Visigothic, and more modern civil and common laws, we can create a law code that is fair, popular, and that maintains our rulers' right to rule."
 guy_artillery_desc: "The lands of Auvergne are rich with ore deposits, especially iron and copper. These metals are strong, easily alloyable, and very malleable, perfect for artillery both large and small."
